🔬 Project Title:

Tumor_Immunity_Gene_Project
A collaborative study between Dr. Guo’s lab and Dr. Cheng’s group

⸻

📁 Project Description:

This project aims to investigate the expression, regulation, and functional impact of tumor-relevant genes across immune cell populations using high-resolution datasets such as single-cell RNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, and public tumor immune databases.

The focus is to identify:
	•	Key immune-modulating genes of interest in the tumor microenvironment (TME)
	•	Gene signatures associated with myeloid cells, T cell subsets, MDSCs, and other immune populations
	•	Functional consequences of gene perturbation (e.g., KO models) in murine and human tumor models

⸻

🔗 Data Sources:
	•	Public databases: TCGA, GEO, ENCODE, UCSC Xena, TIMER2.0, TISIDB
	•	scRNA-seq datasets from glioma and other tumor models
	•	KO/perturbation models from Guo lab
	•	Patient-derived RNA expression (if applicable)

⸻

🧪 Analysis Tools:
	•	R packages: Seurat, DESeq2, SingleR, ggplot2
	•	Python tools: Scanpy, pandas, scikit-learn
	•	Web tools: TIMER2.0, GEPIA2, TISIDB, Ensembl, UCSC Xena
